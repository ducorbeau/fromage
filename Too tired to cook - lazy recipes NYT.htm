<h2>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image001.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 1 sandwich</li>
<li>Time: 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">The trick to great grilled cheese sandwiches isn't in the ingredients, but on the stove. Achieving a golden, crusty outside and oozy inside takes a little patience: if the heat is too high, the outside will scorch before the cheese melts. Cooking the slices separately at first gives the cheese a good head start. There's no need to search out artisanal loaves or local cheese (though they won't hurt), but definitely do not use homemade mayonnaise. Mustard, chutney or even strawberry jam (believe it) can be dabbed on the cheese as it melts, or add ham, prosciutto or slices of apple or tomato (drain on paper towels first). You can use any melting cheese, such as American, Muenster or Swiss, but not too much: part of the perfection here is in the proportion of bread to cheese.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 slices bread, either soft sandwich squares or large peasant-style slices, not more than 1/2 inch thick</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Mayonnaise</li>
<li>1 to 2 ounces grated cheddar (or other cheese), depending on size of bread</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat a heavy pan over medium-low heat.</li>
<li>Thinly spread one side of each bread slice with butter. Spread the other side of each slice with mayonnaise and place the bread, mayonnaise-side-down, in the pan. Divide the cheese evenly on top of the buttered slices. Adjust the heat so the bread sizzles gently.</li>
<li>When the cheese is about halfway melted, use a spatula to flip one slice over on top of the other, and press lightly to melt. Keep turning the sandwich, pressing gently, until the sandwich is compact, both sides are crusty, and the cheese is melted.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Kimchi Grilled Cheese</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image002.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 1 serving</li>
<li>Time: 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Spicy heat plays well with melty cheese (think: queso dip, stuffed jalape&ntilde;os, Buffalo wings and blue cheese). Here, kimchi and mozzarella cheese come together for a twist on the classic grilled cheese. Mildly flavored mozzarella is an especially good choice in this recipe because it lets the kimchi shine, but you could also add 1/4 cup of grated Cheddar, Monterey Jack or even pepper Jack for more kick. If you have grilled steak, roasted vegetables or practically any other savory leftover in your fridge, chop it up and add about 1/4 cup to your sandwich along with the kimchi. Smearing mayonnaise on the bread, instead of butter, might sound weird, but it won&rsquo;t burn as quickly as butter, allowing the cheese ample time to melt, and the bread to toast up to golden perfection.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 slices bread, either soft sandwich bread or large rustic slices, not more than 1/2-inch thick</li>
<li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
<li>&frac12; cup grated mozzarella, Cheddar or other mild, semifirm cheese</li>
<li>&frac14; cup drained and coarsely chopped kimchi</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat a heavy skillet over medium-low heat.&nbsp;Thinly spread 1 side of each slice of bread with 1/2 tbsp mayonnaise. Place the bread, mayonnaise-side-down, in the skillet and divide the mozzarella evenly over the slices.</li>
<li>When the cheese has just melted (no individual shreds of cheese remain), 6 to 10 minutes, add the kimchi to one side.&nbsp;Use a spatula to top with the other slice of bread, cheese-side-down. Press with the spatula to meld, then let cook, covered, flipping as needed to prevent burning, until the bread is crusty-brown and the sandwich is warmed through, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>

<h2>Sardine Toasts With Tomato and Sweet Onion</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image003.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 2 servings</li>
<li>Time: 10 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">A classic pantry meal, sardine toasts are just the thing to eat when you&rsquo;re starving and there&rsquo;s nothing in the house for dinner. If you don&rsquo;t have tomatoes, just leave them out. With their saline flavor and buttery texture, all sardines need is some good bread and a little crunchy onion to set them off.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 thick slices crusty sourdough bread</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, halved</li>
<li>Softened butter, as needed</li>
<li>1 large ripe tomato, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 can sardines (6 to 7 ounces), deboned if you like</li>
<li>&frac14; small sweet or red onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
<li>Fresh lemon juice, to taste</li>
<li>Flaky sea salt</li>
<li>Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
<li>Fresh basil leaves, torn (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Toast the bread under a broiler (on both sides) or in the toaster.</li>
<li>While the toast is still warm, immediately rub it (aggressively!) with the cut side of the garlic clove, then spread toast generously with butter. Top butter with tomato slices and lightly salt them.</li>
<li>Top tomatoes with sardines and then onion slices. Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice, then season with more salt and pepper. Garnish with basil if you like and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Soft-Boiled Eggs With Anchovy Toast</h2>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image004.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">If you&rsquo;re up for a delicious, slightly sporty breakfast, you might consider making some anchovy butter tonight. Take a stick of unsalted butter, and let it soften on the counter while you assemble the other ingredients: a tin of anchovies, some garlic cloves, a shake or two of smoked or regular paprika, a wee splash of lemon juice and maybe, but probably not, some salt. Rinse and mince the little fish, mince the garlic, and fork everything together into the butter to taste.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Then, come morning, you can slather toast with the result and serve it with soft scrambled eggs or, better yet, soft-boiled eggs, a breakfast I once had in London at a hotel and restaurant the chef Fergus Henderson was running in Leicester Square. Make sure you spread the butter &ldquo;wall to wall.&rdquo; That is a vernacular phrase of the chef Gabrielle Hamilton. It means to cover the entire surface of the bread from edge to edge &mdash; an important step in buttering, one that is too often shirked.</p>

<h2>Garlicky Tomato Toast (Pan Con Tomate)</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image005.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 to 6 servings</li>
<li>Time: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Some version of tomatoes on toast &mdash; a juicy American B.L.T. or Italian tomato-topped bruschetta &mdash; is always a good idea, but that's especially true during high summer, when tomatoes are at their peak. One superior combination comes from Barcelona, where a slice of toast is rubbed with garlic and juicy ripe tomatoes, then anointed with olive oil. Most Catalan cooks simply cut the tomato crosswise and vigorously massage the toasted bread with the cut side. Others grate the tomato flesh and spoon it over the bread. This version adds tomato slices and a scattering of cherry tomatoes for a substantial first course.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>3 or 4 very ripe medium tomatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds)</li>
<li>1 pint cherry tomatoes (about 12 ounces)</li>
<li>4 to 6 large slices sturdy sourdough bread, about 1/2-inch thick</li>
<li>4 to 6 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Cut 2 tomatoes in half crosswise. Place a box grater in a shallow bowl and grate the tomato flesh from the cut sides, pushing through the large holes. You should have 1 cup or so of coarse tomato pur&eacute;e. Set pur&eacute;e aside, and discard tomato skins.</li>
<li>Cut remaining large tomatoes into 1/4-inch slices. Cut cherry tomatoes in half. Set aside.</li>
<li>Toast the bread until nicely browned and crisp. (Toasting over a charcoal grill yields a rich, smoky flavor, but a toaster, toaster oven or broiler works just as well.)</li>
<li>With your fingers, rub the top of each toast with a garlic clove. You will see the cloves get smaller as the garlic is dispersed, pushed into the bread. (For a less garlicky toast, press lightly when rubbing.)</li>
<li>Place toasts on a platter or individual plates. Spoon and spread a heaping tbsp of tomato pur&eacute;e over each toast. Then arrange tomato slices and cherry tomatoes randomly on top.</li>
<li>Sprinkle generously with salt, pepper and a tbsp of extra-virgin olive oil per toast. Garnish with whole or torn basil leaves, if using.</li>

<h2>Seamus Mullen's Pan Con Tomate</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image006.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: Serves 4-6</li>
<li>Time: 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Pan con tomate is traditionally a humble dish, a way to make a single tomato and some old bread serve a family for lunch. For Tertulia's version, use a box grater to shred the best tomato you can find. Microplane some garlic into it. Add salt and a big drizzle of fruity Spanish olive oil, then a little less of sherry vinegar. You'll heap this mixture onto a few thick slices of bread, and then scrape most of the tomato off. Add more olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 best-quality tomatoes, very ripe</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, ideally Spanish, plus extra for finishing</li>
<li>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</li>
<li>4-6 slices thick-cut crusty bread</li>
<li>Maldon sea salt or other flaky salt, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Grate the tomatoes on a box grater. Using a microplane, grate the garlic onto the tomatoes. Season with kosher salt, the olive oil and the vinegar, and stir lightly to combine.</li>
<li>Toast or grill the bread until it is lightly charred.</li>
<li>Place a heaping tbsp of the grated tomato mixture onto the bread, then wipe most of it off with the spoon. Drizzle with olive oil again, add the sea salt, then serve immediately.</li>

<h2>Scarlett&rsquo;s Tuna Salad</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image007.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: Serves 4 as a side or 2 as dinner</li>
<li>Time: 15 minutes, plus 1 hour for pickling</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">For when it&rsquo;s too hot to cook, there's the chef Scarlett Lindeman&rsquo;s tuna salad &mdash; the same one she serves at her Mexico City restaurant, Cicatriz. Made with high-quality, oil-packed tuna, the salad is fresh, juicy, bright and summery, composed with cucumbers, avocado, pickled onion and lots of herbs. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to season the cucumbers generously with salt at the start, and to season more as you build the layers of the salad. The dish is so simple that seasoning it well is key.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>&frac12; cup rice-wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>1 red onion, peeled, halved and thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 Persian cucumbers, peeled if skin is thick and waxy, sliced about 1/4-inch thick</li>
<li>2 spring onions, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 limes, juiced, about 1/4 cup</li>
<li>5 to 7 ounces olive-oil-packed tuna</li>
<li>1 avocado, peeled and cubed</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon or more finishing salt, such as Maldon</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>Handful basil leaves, washed and torn</li>
<li>Handful cilantro sprigs, washed and torn</li>
<li>Handful fresh mint leaves, washed and torn</li>
<li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>In a clean glass jar with a tightfitting lid, mix vinegar, sugar and 1 teaspoon kosher salt with 1/2 cup hot water. Shake until sugar is dissolved. Bring a pot of water to the boil, and add the onions. Let it sit for just a few seconds in the hot water, then drain well and transfer onions to the jar with the vinegar. The pickled onions will be ready to use in an hour, or can be made ahead and kept in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, dress the cucumber and spring onions with the remaining kosher salt and lime juice. It should be fairly wet. Pour into a deep serving plate or a wide bowl, along with any extra liquid at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
<li>Spoon tuna out of the oil, and use your hands to break it into bite-size pieces, directly into the now-empty mixing bowl. Add avocado, 3 tbsp of pickled red onion and 1 tbsp of pickling liquid from the jar, and mix gently with your hands to dress. Scatter over the cucumber mixture, and season with finishing salt and black pepper. Cover with torn herbs, and generously drizzle everything with olive oil. Eat right away, with spoons.</li>

<h2>Fried Egg Quesadilla</h2>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image008.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">This simple fried egg quesadilla makes as fine a light supper as it does a breakfast repast. Easy work: Melt some butter in a pan and gently cook a corn tortilla in it. Top the tortilla with grated Cheddar, a slice of deli ham or some cooked bacon if you want them, a little chopped cilantro or salsa or hot sauce, and another tortilla. Cook, flipping the quesadilla a few times, until it is crisp and golden and the cheese has melted into lace at the sides. Use a spatula to pull it out of the pan, and place it onto a cutting board to rest. Fry an egg in the now-empty pan with a little more butter, then cut the quesadilla into quarters, placing the egg on top. Top with cilantro and hot sauce or salsa.</p>

<h2>Chinese-Style Breakfast Egg Wrap (Jian Bing)</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image009.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 1 wrap</li>
<li>Time: 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Throughout northern China and Taiwan, street vendors start peddling jian bing as the sun rises. They spread the wheat flour and mung bean batter on a large griddle and spread it thin, then crack an egg or two on top. They scatter on scallions, cilantro and pickled mustard greens, and scramble and spread the mix before squirting on hoisin sauce and chile paste. Sometimes, they add sliced lettuce or wonton crisps for crunch. Making jian bing is a specialized skill and not easily recreated, but this approximation delivers the pleasure and convenience of an omelet cooked onto a thin pancake, the pancake here being store-bought flour tortillas.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 (8-inch) flour tortilla</li>
<li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 scallion, thinly sliced (about 2 tbsp)</li>
<li>2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (about 4 sprigs)</li>
<li>1 tbsp Chinese pickled mustard greens (optional)</li>
<li>Hoisin sauce, chile paste and sesame seeds, for serving (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Beat the eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt with a fork until almost blended with some yellow streaks remaining.</li>
<li>Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Put the tortilla in it and turn until warm and pliable, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.</li>
<li>Raise the heat to medium-high. Add the oil to the skillet, then the scallion and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until just bright green and tender, about 30 seconds. Add the eggs, vigorously stir with a silicone spatula to scramble lightly, then quickly spread in an even layer. Scatter on the cilantro and pickled greens, if using, then immediately press the warmed tortilla on top and let cook until the egg just sets and sticks to the tortilla, about 30 seconds. Flip onto a plate, egg facing up.</li>
<li>If using, drizzle the hoisin sauce and chile paste over the egg and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Fold in quarters and serve immediately or wrap in foil to eat out of hand.</li>

<h2>A Perfect Hard-Boiled Egg</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image010.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: Varies</li>
<li>Time: 20 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Master this simple technique and every hard-boiled egg you make from here on out will have a perfectly-cooked, creamy sunshine center. Here are loads of recipes to make with them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place eggs in a single layer in a heavy saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 1 inch. Add 1 teaspoon salt (Salting the water helps minimize leaks if the eggs crack in the pan; the egg whites coagulate and seal off the crack more quickly). Turn the heat to high. As soon as the water comes to a gentle boil, turn off the heat and cover the pan.</li>
<li>For creamy yolks, remove the lid after 10 minutes and run cold water over eggs for 1 minute. Set aside to cool at room temperature. For firmer yolks, leave the eggs to cool in the cooking water, uncovered, for up to 2 hours. To test if an egg has been cooked, spin it on a counter. A hard boiled egg spins faster than a raw egg.</li>
<li>To peel, gently tap a boiled egg against the counter, turning and tapping to make a crackle pattern. Start peeling at the broad end, where there is an air pocket. Running the egg under cold water is not necessary, unless they are too hot to handle.</li>
</ol>
<div><hr />
<h2>Crispy Oven Bacon and Eggs</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image011.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Bacon browns and crisps evenly in the oven without the hassle of flipping slices on the stovetop, while eggs can oven-fry alongside for perfect sunny-side-up runny yolks and tender whites. The oven&rsquo;s encompassing heat helps egg whites set on top before the yolks start to stiffen. Make sure to have the eggs sit at room temperature before cracking them into the hot pan: It ensures they&rsquo;ll cook quickly and evenly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>8 bacon slices</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>Toast, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Take the eggs out of the refrigerator. Place a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 450 degrees.</li>
<li>Arrange the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer, spacing evenly. Roast in the center of the oven until the fat renders and the bacon curls, about 8 minutes. Very thin slices will cook more quickly; thick-cut ones will take longer.</li>
<li>Take the pan out of the oven and quickly flip the bacon and move to one side of the pan. Crack the eggs onto the other side, then immediately return the pan to the oven and roast until the whites are just set, the yolks are still runny and the bacon is brown and crisp, 2 to 5 minutes longer. If you prefer medium or hard egg yolks or extra-crisp bacon, cook a few minutes more, but take out the bacon before it burns.</li>
<li>Using a spatula, cut the eggs apart. Slide them off the pan and onto plates right away to stop the yolks from solidifying. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain the bacon on paper towels, then add to the plate along with toast. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Huevos Rotos (Broken Eggs)</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image012.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Variations of this hearty fried egg-and-potato dish can be found throughout Spain, including the Canary Islands, where it&rsquo;s said to have originated. There&rsquo;s always a runny egg, but whether it sits atop fried potato rounds, French fries or crunchy chips varies by region and personal preference. The potatoes are often served with chorizo sausage or Serrano ham, but in this vegetarian version, smoked paprika and red-pepper flakes mimic chorizo&rsquo;s flavor and heat. Pierce the eggs just before serving so the golden yolks coat the potatoes with a glossy sauce. Serve with saut&eacute;ed greens or a crisp salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette. This one-pan meal is good with a cup of coffee or a beer &mdash; it&rsquo;s breakfast, lunch or dinner material.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>&frac13; cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
<li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon red-pepper flakes or 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>2 pounds new potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces if necessary</li>
<li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
<li>Flaky sea salt, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>In a measuring cup, combine the olive oil, paprika, red-pepper flakes, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, a generous grind of pepper and 1 cup water. Put the potatoes in a large skillet and pour the olive oil mixture over them. Bring to a boil, then cover and cook on high until the potatoes are fork-tender, 6 to 9 minutes.</li>
<li>Uncover and turn the heat to low. If the potatoes are sticking or dry, add more olive oil. Arrange the potatoes in an even layer, cut side down if halved, then add the onion and garlic surrounding the potatoes. Cover and cook until the potatoes are golden-brown and the onions are softened, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir the potatoes (if they&rsquo;re sticking, add more oil). Make 4 nests in the potatoes and crack an egg into each. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
<li>To serve, break the yolks gently with a serving spoon, then scoop some potatoes and an egg onto plates or into shallow bowls. Serve with a squeeze of lemon and flaky salt.</li>

<h2>The Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image013.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 2 servings</li>
<li>Time: 40 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">For silky, outrageously good scrambled eggs, cook them low and slow. This method, which Mark Bittman learned from James Beard, is very low and very slow: you place the eggs over very low heat, stirring frequently, breaking up the curds as they form. The results are without compare. Make them for breakfast on the weekend, while the coffee brews and the bacon fries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 or 5 eggs</li>
<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>2 tbsp cream</li>
<li>2 tbsp butter or extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them, just until the yolks and whites are combined. Season with salt and pepper and beat in the cream.</li>
<li>Put a medium skillet, preferably non-stick, over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the butter or oil and swirl it around the pan. After the butter melts, but before it foams, turn the heat to low.</li>
<li>Add the eggs to the skillet and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. At first nothing will happen; after 10 minutes or so, the eggs will begin to form curds. Do not lose patience: Keep stirring, breaking up the curds as they form, until the mixture is a mass of soft curds. This will take 30 minutes or more. Serve immediately.</li>

<h2>Basic Stovetop Rice</h2>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image014.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 3 servings</li>
<li>Time: Up to 45 minutes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 cup rice (long-grain or medium-grain, like basmati or jasmine; short-grain, like sushi rice; or brown rice)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Pour rice into a bowl, and fill it with cold water. Swirl the grains, using your fingers. Tip out any starchy water, and repeat until water runs almost clear.</li>
<li>Combine rice and water in a pot: For most long-grain and medium-grain rice, pair 1 cup rice and 1&frac13; /3
cups water. For short-grain rice, use 1 cup rice and 1 cup water. For most brown rice, combine 1 cup rice and 1 3/4 cups water. The rice and water should not come more than halfway up the sides of your pot; the mixture will double in volume as it cooks.</li>
<li>Bring water to a hard boil over medium-high heat. The water's entire surface should break with big, constant bubbles. As soon as water is boiling, give it a vigorous stir with a spatula or wooden spoon, making sure to scrape at any grains at the bottom of the pot. Cover it with a lid and turn the heat to low.</li>
<li>Cook long-grain and medium-grain rice for 15 minutes; short-grain varieties for 20 minutes; and brown rice for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>When allotted time has passed, or when you hear a change in sound &ndash; if you listen closely, you&rsquo;ll notice the sounds will slowly change from a bubbly simmer to a steamy sort of flutter &ndash; turn off heat and let rice rest for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>

<h2>Whatever You&rsquo;ve Got Fried Rice</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image015.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Start with some cooked rice, white or brown, a cup or so per person, made fresh or pulled from the freezer where you keep some in a plastic bag against the promise of just such an exercise. (The chill helps separate the grains.) Also helpful, also in the freezer: bags of diced organic vegetables you can get at the market (the mixed corn, carrots and peas number, for instance). For the rest: meat if you eat meat, a couple eggs, lots of chopped garlic and ginger, some scallions. You can make a sauce from soy sauce and sesame oil (about a 3:1 ratio) and fire it up with a teaspoon or two of gochujang. You&rsquo;ll need a little less than a quarter cup of sauce to feed four.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">To the wok! Crank the heat, add a little neutral oil, then toss in your meat. I like chopped brisket from the barbecue joint, or pastrami from the deli, or ground pork, or bacon, or leftover roast chicken &mdash; whatever you decide on, you&rsquo;ll need far less than you think. After the meat crisps, fish it from the pan and add about a tbsp each of minced garlic and ginger, a handful of chopped scallions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds or so, then add those frozen vegetables. More stir-frying. Return the meat to the wok. Stir-fry. Clear a space in the center of the wok and add the eggs, cooking them quickly to softness. Throw in the sauce, then the rice, and mix it all together until it&rsquo;s steaming hot. Finish with more chopped scallions.</p>

<h2>Rice With an Egg on Top</h2>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image016.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">When I&rsquo;m tired, it&rsquo;s rice in a bowl. This is mentally available only because a rice cooker lives on our kitchen counter. I fry an egg to put on top, or maybe I&rsquo;m lucky and there&rsquo;s already a hard-boiled egg in the fridge. I drizzle on toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and rice vinegar (or a squeeze of lime). Mixing these items in a separate bowl in a measured ratio is out of the question. I add toasted sesame seeds, more salt and sliced cucumber or saut&eacute;ed bok choy, but only if the stars align and we have a vegetable. The full exhaustion version is just rice, egg and chile oil.</p>

<h2>Vegetable Risotto</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image017.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 2 servings</li>
<li>Time: 40 minutes <br />
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Dried mushrooms are reconstituted in hot water. Lettuce and fennel are sweated down in some hot butter in a big, heavy-bottomed pot, then set aside. Onion takes their place, followed by short-grained arborio rice, followed by hot water. Then the cook stirs and stirs, performing the old dance of risotto. (I tried the dish using the stock left by the mushrooms but found it too muddy and dank.) The mushrooms, diced small, go into the pot along with some more water and stirring. Then, at the end, the lettuce and fennel, some Parmesan, a heavy dusting of nutmeg and whatever butter is left. The result is remarkable, particularly in the matter of the lettuce, a mineral thread of flavor above the soft forest floor of the rice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>&frac12; ounce dried mushrooms</li>
<li>6 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>5 green leaf lettuce leaves, shredded</li>
<li>1 leaf of a fennel bulb, finely diced</li>
<li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
<li>1 cup arborio rice</li>
<li>2 tbsp grated Parmesan</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>Nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Put the mushrooms in a bowl, and pour hot water over them. Allow them to steep for 20 minutes, then squeeze them out and mince. Reserve the mushroom broth for another purpose.</li>
<li>Put four cups of water in a pot, and set it over high heat to boil. Keep it hot.</li>
<li>In a heavy saucepan set over medium heat, melt 5 tbsp butter and when it foams, cook the lettuce and fennel until soft. Lift them out of the pan and set aside. Add another tbsp of butter if necessary, and cook the onion until translucent. Add the rice, and stir until it is glistening and hot.</li>
<li>Add a cup of the hot water to the mixture, and stir it until the liquid is absorbed, approximately 5 minutes. Add another cup of the water, and stir again until it is absorbed. Add the mushrooms, and stir again, then add a pinch of salt and another half cup of the hot water. When the liquid has been absorbed, taste the rice to see if the grains offer the slightest resistance to your teeth. If not, add the rest of the water, and stir again to combine.</li>
<li>Stir in the lettuce, the fennel, the Parmesan and any remaining butter, then grate nutmeg generously over the mixture.</li>

<h2>Takeout-Style Sesame Noodles</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image018.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 10 minutes <br />
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Noodles dressed with sesame are popular in many parts of China, but this particular style, made with peanut butter and served cold, became a Chinese-American staple in the United States in the 1970s. The family of Shorty Tang &mdash; an ambitious restaurateur who emigrated from Sichuan to Taipei to New York &mdash; firmly believes that he invented the dish and still serve it at Hwa Yuan, the restaurant he opened in 1967 in Manhattan&rsquo;s Chinatown. They have never divulged the exact recipe; this is our own lush but refreshing version.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 pound noodles, frozen or (preferably) fresh</li>
<li>2 tbsp sesame oil, plus a splash</li>
<li>3 &frac12; tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tbsp Chinese rice vinegar</li>
<li>2 tbsp Chinese sesame paste &ndash; you could use tahini in a pinch</li>
<li>1 tbsp smooth peanut butter</li>
<li>1 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 tbsp finely grated ginger</li>
<li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
<li>2 teaspoons chile-garlic paste, chile crisp or chile oil, or to taste</li>
<li>Half a cucumber, peeled, seeded and cut into 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch by 2-inch sticks</li>
<li>&frac14; cup chopped roasted peanuts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until barely tender, about 5 minutes. They should retain a hint of chewiness. Drain, rinse with cold water, drain again and toss with a splash of sesame oil.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tbsp sesame oil, the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame paste, peanut butter, sugar, ginger, garlic and chili-garlic paste.</li>
<li>Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss. Transfer to a serving bowl, and garnish with cucumber and peanuts.</li>

<h2>Chile-Oil Noodles With Cilantro</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image019.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 20 minutes <br />
<p style="margin-left:2em;">In this 20-minute recipe, a mixture of savory condiments coats bowlfuls of wide noodles chilled slightly by a quick rinse in cool water. While you cook the udon, take the time to prepare the sauce, abundant with contrasting flavors, and the fresh herbs. The sauce can be made in advance, but make sure it&rsquo;s at room temperature before tossing it with the noodles and the cilantro at the last minute. Substitutions are welcome: Swap in chile crisp in place of the chile oil with crunchy garlic, or scallions in place of garlic chives. Sichuan chile oil brings a citrusy flavor that is hard to replicate, so don&rsquo;t skip it. It can vary in spice level: For a milder sauce, use only the liquid oil, or add Sichuan peppercorns from the bottom of the oil for extra tingle. Fried shallots are here for texture, but omit them if you use chile crisp.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>14 ounces dried udon noodles</li>
<li>&frac14; cup chile oil with crunchy garlic</li>
<li>2 tbsp pure sesame oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Sichuan chile oil, or to taste</li>
<li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
<li>&frac12; cup finely sliced garlic chives or scallions, plus more for garnish</li>
<li>2 tbsp store-bought fried shallots, crumbled by hand (optional)</li>
<li>&frac12; cup finely chopped cilantro (see Note), plus a few sprigs for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook noodles according to package instructions, stirring from time to time to prevent them from sticking. Drain well in a colander, then run noodles under cold water until cooled.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine all three oils with the soy sauce and 1/2 cup garlic chives.</li>
<li>Toss cooled noodles into the chile oil mixture. Gently fold in the crumbled fried shallots and chopped cilantro. Divide among four bowls, and top with more garlic chives and cilantro sprigs.</li>

<h2>Marcella Hazan&rsquo;s Tomato Sauce</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image020.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 1 hour <br />
<p style="margin-left:2em;">This is perhaps the most famous recipe created by Marcella Hazan, the cookbook author who changed how Americans cook Italian food. It also may be her easiest. Use your favorite canned tomatoes for this and don&rsquo;t be scared off by the butter. It gives the sauce an unparalleled velvety richness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices (for example, a 28-ounce can of San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes)</li>
<li>5 tbsp butter</li>
<li>1 onion, peeled and cut in half</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt.</li>
<li>Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon. Add salt as needed.</li>
<li>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta. This recipe makes enough sauce for a pound of pasta.</li>

<h2>Pasta Alla Vodka</h2>
</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image021.jpg" /></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 to 6 servings</li>
<li>Time: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">There&rsquo;s no need to order takeout from your neighborhood restaurant when this beloved, easy-to-assemble Italian-American classic gets dinner on the table in no time. Adding pancetta brings a salty smokiness, but if you leave it out, you&rsquo;re still in for a quick and flavorful dish. If you&rsquo;re feeling ambitious, the pasta is delightful with Caesar salad or garlic bread, but it&rsquo;s also satisfying enough to take centerstage. Put on some Puccini, open up a bottle of red and you&rsquo;re guaranteed a more relaxed dining experience than the one you might get at the local red-and-white checkered-tablecloth joint.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 pound rigatoni or penne pasta</li>
<li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>4 ounces diced pancetta, optional</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>&frac12; teaspoon red-pepper flakes</li>
<li>&frac34; cup vodka</li>
<li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>&frac34; cup heavy cream</li>
<li>&frac14; cup grated Grana Padano or Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
<li>1 tbsp roughly chopped fresh oregano</li>
<li>2 tbsp roughly chopped Italian parsley</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (2 heaping tbsp kosher salt to about 7 quarts water). Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: Heat the oil in a deep 12-inch skillet or pot over medium. Add the pancetta, if using, and fry until crispy, stirring occasionally, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and red-pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Turn the heat to medium-low, add the vodka and cook until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the tomatoes and then fill the can halfway with water and swish it around to loosen up any leftover tomatoes; add a quarter to half of the water to the pan. Simmer until the sauce begins to thicken, about 10 minutes, and season with salt and pepper. If you prefer your sauce a little looser, go ahead and add the remaining water and simmer 2 to 3 minutes more. Reduce heat to low, add the cream and cook, stirring, until the sauce becomes an even pinkish-rust color, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Stir in the cooked pasta and 1/4 cup cheese; toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls, top with additional cheese, if desired, and sprinkle with the oregano and parsley.</li>

<li>Yield: 3 to 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">There are about a gazillion ways to cook pasta using other pantry staples &mdash; things like garlic, bread crumbs, pecorino, capers, olives and especially, canned fish. This recipe, pasta with tuna, anchovies and capers, showered with lots of green herbs and scallions, is one of my family&rsquo;s household favorites. I like it with a long, thin, twirlable pasta &mdash; spaghetti, linguine or bucatini &mdash; but you can use whatever pasta you have on hand. Even macaroni works just fine and might even persuade your finicky kid to eat this dish (though, so far, mine abstains).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>12 ounces long, thin pasta, such as bucatini, spaghetti or linguine</li>
<li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
<li>6 to 10 anchovies, chopped</li>
<li>3 tbsp drained capers</li>
<li>1 cup torn fresh herbs, such as parsley and dill, or celery leaves, plus more for serving (optional)</li>
<li>1 (5- or 6-ounce) can tuna, drained</li>
<li>Red-pepper flakes, for serving</li>
<li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>In a well-salted pot of boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain, saving 1 cup pasta water.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add garlic and scallion whites, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add anchovies and capers and cook until anchovies melt and capers and garlic turn golden, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Add 1/2 cup pasta water, let it reduce until there is just a little left in the pan, then add pasta and herbs and toss well to coat. Add tuna and toss well.</li>
<li>Serve with red-pepper flakes on top, more herbs, scallion greens, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing.</li>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">This late-night Roman staple is astonishingly full-flavored. Start the water before you do anything else, because the sauce takes less than 10 minutes start to finish.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>2 to 3 whole fresh peperoncini (small red chiles), or small dried red chiles</li>

<li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
<li>&frac14; cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
<li>&frac34; pound linguine or spaghetti</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Put a pot of salted water on to boil. Remove the stems of the peperoncini, halve them lengthwise, then slice them into 1/4-inch lengths. Put the oil, garlic and peperoncini in a large deep pan set over medium-high heat, and cook until the garlic is translucent and golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the parsley to the pan, and turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, cook the pasta until it is aldente, nearly but not quite done and still a bit chalky in the middle. Drain, and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid.</li>
<li>When the oil has cooled for a couple of minutes, add 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, and reduce over high heat by about half. Add the pasta, and stir vigorously as it continues to cook. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time as necessary to finish cooking the pasta, and develop the thickened sauce. Season with salt, and serve.</li>

<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 1 hour</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">This incredibly easy one-pan dinner is from the cookbook &ldquo;The Silver Spoon for Children,&rdquo; with more than 40 traditional recipes adapted from &ldquo;The Silver Spoon,&rdquo; a book that appears in many home kitchens in Italy. Older children with some experience can follow this recipe as is, but if you&rsquo;ve got little ones who want to help, they can stir the sage, beans and apple juice together in a large bowl while the sausages bake, then you can pour the mixture into the hot pan. If you like your beans on the saucy side, add 1/4 cup more apple juice&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">. Serve with buttered crusty rolls and something leafy and green. &mdash;Margaux Laskey</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 sweet Italian pork sausages (about 1 pound)</li>
<li>2 whole garlic cloves (do not peel)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 fresh sage leaves</li>
<li>2 (15-ounce) cans cannellini beans, rinsed and drained</li>
<li>&frac34; cup unsweetened apple juice</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, prick the sausages all over with a fork. Add the garlic, drizzle with the olive oil and toss to coat. Bake until the sausages start to brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Put on your oven mitts, take the roasting pan out of the oven and set it on a heatproof surface. Using tongs, carefully turn the sausages over. (The sausages will brown on the other side when they go back into the oven.)</li>
<li>Tear the sage leaves into little pieces and add them to the sausages along with the drained beans and apple juice. Give the bean mixture a stir.</li>
<li>Wearing your oven mitts, put the roasting pan back in the oven and bake until the bean mixture is warmed, about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Put on your oven mitts one last time to remove the roasting pan from the oven. To serve, carefully stir everything together using a wooden spoon, and add a little salt and pepper to taste.</li>

<h2>Baked Tofu With Peanut Sauce and Coconut-Lime Rice</h2>

<div>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 25 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">A spicy, fragrant peanut sauce reminiscent of the groundnut stews that are popular across West Africa anchors this recipe. Any protein would be lucky to be doused and marinated in it, but tofu soaks up the peanut sauce&rsquo;s flavors and chars up nicely upon roasting. Red miso and fish sauce provide umami, honey lends a subtle sweetness and the lime zest in the coconut rice brightens it all. Finished with pickled peppers and fresh sliced scallions, this dish comes together to make an exciting but quick weeknight dinner.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp peanut or vegetable oil, plus drizzle</li>
<li>&frac23; cup lime juice, and zest of 1 lime</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 bell pepper, stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup long-grain rice like jasmine or basmati</li>
<li>&frac12; cup full-fat coconut milk</li>
<li>1 cup smooth, natural peanut butter</li>
<li>1 tbsp red miso</li>
<li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
<li>1 tbsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons chopped habanero pepper, stem and seeds removed, or 1 tbsp sambal</li>
<li>2 tbsp buckwheat honey or molasses</li>
<li>2 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and sliced crosswise, 1/4-inch thick</li>
<li>3 cups arugula, mizuna or baby mustard</li>
<li>2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat the oven to 450 degrees and lightly brush a large rimmed sheet pan with oil.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir 4 tbsp lime juice with 1/2 teaspoon salt until salt dissolves. Add the sliced peppers, a few cracks of black pepper and set aside.</li>
<li>In a small pot, combine the rice with 1 cup water and the coconut milk. Season with salt and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook over medium-low until the rice is just tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, until ready to serve.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, whisk 4 tbsp lime juice with the peanut butter, miso, ginger, fish sauce (if using), habanero, 2 tbsp oil, 1 tbsp honey and 3/4 cup water. Stir until smooth and season to taste with salt.</li>
<li>Arrange the tofu pieces in a single layer on the oiled baking sheet and season with salt. Spoon about 2 tbsp of the peanut sauce over each, covering the top and allowing the sauce to run down and coat the sides. Drizzle the tops with some oil, and roast until glaze is set, deep brown and caramelized along the edges, 18 to 20 minutes. Add the remaining lime juice and 1 tbsp honey to the leftover peanut sauce in the bowl to make the dressing; set aside.</li>
<li>Divide the greens among bowls. Add the lime zest and half the sliced scallions to the rice, then fluff with a fork. Top the greens with the rice, then the tofu. Spoon the peanut dressing over everything, and garnish with the drained pickled peppers and remaining sliced scallions.</li>

<h2>Salmon and Tomatoes in Foil</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p style="margin-left:2em;"><img src="lazy_images/image027.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Yield: 4 servings</li>
<li>Time: 30 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left:2em;">Here is a simple recipe for salmon prepared en papillote (a fancy name for &ldquo;in paper,&rdquo; though like most everyone else these days, you will use aluminum foil). Layer salmon, tomato and basil on lightly oiled foil and wrap it all up &mdash; you can even do it a night before cooking. When the time for dinner comes, you can steam, grill, roast or pan-grill the packages &mdash; though our testing shows roasting is easiest. You can substitute almost anything comparable for each of the ingredients: salmon can be replaced by any fish steak or fillet, or by boneless, skinless chicken breast. The herb and vegetable can also be varied at will, as long as the vegetable will finish cooking at the same time as the protein: if you were cooking broccoli, for example, you would have to cut it into small pieces; if carrots, you'd have to parboil them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1&frac12; to 2 pounds salmon fillet, cut crosswise (4 pieces)</li>
<li>12 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>16 basil leaves</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>For each of 4 packages, place one 12-inch-long sheet of aluminum foil on top of another. Smear top sheet with 1/2 tbsp olive oil, and layer a fillet of salmon, 6 tomato halves, salt and pepper, 4 basil leaves and another half tbsp oil. Seal package by folding foil onto itself and crimping edges tightly. Repeat to make other packages, and refrigerate until ready to cook, no more than 24 hours later.</li>
<li>When you are ready to cook, heat oven to 500 degrees. Place packages in a roasting pan. (Or they can be cooked on top of the stove in 2 skillets over medium-high heat.) Cook 5 minutes (for medium-rare) to 8 minutes from the time the mixture starts to sizzle, or roughly 10 to 12 minutes total.</li>
<li>Let packages rest a minute, and cut a slit along the top with a knife. Use a knife and fork to open the package. Spoon the salmon, garnish and juices onto a plate, and serve.</li>

<li>Place the potatoes in the oven, and roast for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the potatoes, until they offer no resistance when a knife is inserted in their centers.</li>
<li>Remove the potatoes from the oven, slice them open down the middle, apply a tbsp of butter to each one and serve immediately.</li>
